    <h3> Blockchain Based Online Auction System</h3>
    <div id="myContainer">

<p>E-Commerce came into existence with the internet. E-Commerce was developed with the purpose of operating transactions
    electronically. Due to this rapid growth of e-commerce it spread into many dimensions, one of which is e-auction. Online platforms
    removed the limitations such as product variety and availability, deals on product and geographical barriers. E-Auction has totally
    changed how auctions used to work. Some of the items that go in e-auction are; flowers, antiques, signal spectrum etc. Artists use eauction
    in order to sell their art where the government also uses e-auction in order to sell signal spectrums. Auctions are organized
    and formalized according to the auction host it is up to the auction host to set formalities like whether the winner bid has to be
    announced at the end or not, weather to set limitation on the number of items that could be bought or not whether the auction can be
    held for public bidders or private bidders like such. Some auction platforms involve centralized and third party intermediaries which
    raises a critical concern regarding the legitimacy of bits, the security, transparency and the integrity of the data. Blockchain is a
    system recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system and Smart Contract
    is a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions
    according to the terms and condition of a contract or an agreement. These technologies provide the best security and make the
    system fully secure. Thus, involving blockchain and smart contract in our E-auction platform will resolve many of above discussed
    concerns. Also, the decentralized feature does not involve any third party or any government control. All of the work is directly
    happen between the bidder and seller. At the end e-auction helps both the buyer and the seller by reducing the time and the price of
    goods and services.</p>
